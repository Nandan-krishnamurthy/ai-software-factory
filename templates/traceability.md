# Traceability

Requirement → Story → PR → Test, across every increment of this project. S05 creates this file and adds one row per requirement; each story PR updates its own rows at S11, so a row is merged together with the code it describes.

A requirement is **Done** when its row says `Implemented` and every PR listed for it is merged. `/factory-status` works that out from GitHub; it is not written here.

Status is one of: `Not started`, `In progress`, `Implemented`, `Deferred`.
